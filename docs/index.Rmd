### Introduction and Methods Overview 

This is an R Markdown document created for the final project for the Data Management/GIS course. It includes data and pictures from my thesis titled: "**Assessing the adaptive response of reciprocally outplanted *Orbicella annularis* along nearshore and offshore reefs in St Thomas, US Virgin Islands**". 32 parent colonies across 4 sites (2 turbid nearshore and 2 clear offshore locations) were sampled via fragmentation in February 2023. These fragments were then outplanted along their natal reefs and the other corresponding foreign reefs, i.e. a reciprocal outplant. Every month for 12-months, environmental parameters and coral health/survivability are monitored. The objectives of this study are to 1) be able to measure and quantify the environmental characteristics across four sites and 2) assess and understand the differences in physiological reaction of outplanted coral.

### Preliminary Data
Below I have included bar graphs of the health data of my fragments across the 4 experimental sites. This is only a snapshot of what they were exhibiting in late October (8 months into the study) after the heat stress from the summer months.

### Early Conclusions
It is interesting how much can change each month. At the halfway mark of my project, coral sourced from Hassel Island had remained healthy across all 4 sites. Given its heartiness, I was ready to suggest we use coral from areas comparable to this area for restoration projects. That was premature, however, as we hadn't yet seen the impacts of the summer bleaching event. At 8 months, things seem less conclusive. But I still have lots of growth, HOBO, and PAR data to go through and analyze (-:
