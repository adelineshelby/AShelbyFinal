## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document created for the final project for the Data Management/GIS course. It includes data and pictures from my thesis titled: "Assessing the adaptive response of reciprocally outplanted *Orbicella annularis* along nearshore and offshore reefs in St Thomas, US Virgin Islands" 

blah blah blah i dont understand wht this stopped owrking

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
